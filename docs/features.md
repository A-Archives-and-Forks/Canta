## Core Features

### Safe Uninstallation
No permanent device damage risk can be done when uninstalling apps with Canta. The uninstallation process happens for current user
only, so APKs remain on device. In case you uninstall a critical system component, you can risk a bootloop.
In that case, you will need to perform a factory reset and the device will not be bricked.

::: info
Canta calls Android System APIs directly to uninstall apps, similar to how ADB does it.
